# KNN-and-KMeans
Program to demonstrate KNN and KMeans Clustering by applying on a multi class data set. 

The data used is: **Dry Beans Dataset**. 

The data set can be retrieved from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset

## What has been implemented:
:heavy_check_mark: K nearest neighbour

:heavy_check_mark: K means clustering 

:heavy_check_mark: For K-means clustering clustering quality is being measured using Davies Bouldin Index

:heavy_check_mark: Visualization of data after clustering using **matplotlib**

:heavy_check_mark: Showing results using :
  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  *  F1 Measure
